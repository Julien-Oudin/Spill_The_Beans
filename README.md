# Spill the Beans ðŸ¥•

An EFREI project to create a website that references healthy and affordable recipes. 


## Documentation

In this project, we implemented a basic authentication system that stores user credentials in the browser's localStorage. This  approach was chosen to focus on functionality, but we are fully aware of its security limitations.

Although this method enabled us to create a working login system, we are aware that it is not secure for real-world use. Credentials are stored in clear text, making them vulnerable to exposure and password protection.
